# AboutTime

An iOS app that allows to read time from analog clock images.   

Based on a supercool [It's About Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09162) [paper](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/time/) and their [github repo](https://github.com/charigyang/itsabouttime).

Trained models mentioned in the paper are available and were converted to CoreML.

The perspective warping algorithm has been ported from authors' python implementation as a custom `CIWarpFilter`.
